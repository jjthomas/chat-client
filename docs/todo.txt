1. Address Hayden's email comments.
3. Update design doc to reflect changes to design -- for example, 
we now have a Disconnect client-to-server message (faked),
and a map to store SSocketInputWorkers whose corresponding clients 
have not yet claimed a handle. We also have modified some of the
message datatypes.
4. Make sure client behaves appropriately when the server disconnects (in the case
of an Exception).
5. AtomicLong to concurrency strategy?
6. Convert everything to Collection
7. Have strategy to quickly find conversations for a particular user. Also,
should we always fake a client disconnect or should the client send
us a disconnect when it was able to shut down properly (i.e. EXIT all
conversations first).
8. Move Server.java code to an actual instance method, not main.
9. Mqke robust to bad input? i.e. add_user with unavailable users, try to send
message for conversation with unrecognized ID
10. Changed line separator to /
11. iteration doesn't work with synchronized
12. make sure the controller's role is clear
13. make sure we can handle newlines and whatnot after the change of separator to / (and slash in the message) -- 
use some sort of consolidate method that combines all components[] after 4 (or however many we expected without any slashes)
14. make sure to test correct behavior for amendment (ClientInputProcessorTest)
15. add tests for message package
