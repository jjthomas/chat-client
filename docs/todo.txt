3. Update design doc to reflect changes to design -- for example, 
we now have a Disconnect client-to-server message (faked),
and a map to store SSocketInputWorkers whose corresponding clients 
have not yet claimed a handle. We also have modified some of the
message datatypes.
5. AtomicLong to concurrency strategy?
8. Move Server.java code to an actual instance method, not main.
9. Mqke robust to bad input? i.e. add_user with unavailable users, try to send
message for conversation with unrecognized ID
10. Changed line separator to /
12. make sure the controller's role is clear
13. make sure we can handle newlines and whatnot after the change of separator 
to / (and slash in the message) -- watch for any user input (handle + chat messags) 
use some sort of consolidate method that combines all components[] after 4 
(or however many we expected without any slashes)
16. add minimal comments throughout (try to make reference to design 
doc as much as possible)
17. will we actually show a list of online users not in the conversation
when "add users" is clicked? or will we show all users 
18. make sure add user on server works properly when you add yourself to
chat (click on yourself in chat window)
19. show chat history not based on id for two-person chats but based on
actual user
20. solve concurrency bugs on server (related to original milestone 1
blocking queue claim) or switch to a single-threaded queue server
21. review GUI code

Santhosh:
14. make sure to test correct behavior for amendment (ClientInputProcessorTest)
15. add tests for message package

Back burner:
6. Convert everything to Collection
4. Make sure client behaves appropriately when the server disconnects (in the case
of an Exception).
