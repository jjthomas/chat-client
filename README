Worked on this 6.005 final project with Yuqing Zhang and Santhosh Narayan in Spring 2013.

Project requirements are described here:
http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/sp13/projects/guichat/

Server:
Run Server.java. If a port other than 5000 is desired, it must be specified as the first command-line argument.

Client:
Run Client.java. In the first dialog that pops up, enter the hostname or IP of the server machine (localhost for 
the local system), followed by
a port suffix (e.g. ':4000') if the server is not running on the standard port (5000).
